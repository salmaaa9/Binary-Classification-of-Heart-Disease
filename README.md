# Binary-Classification-of-Heart-Disease

Objective:
The goal is to build a binary classification model using a with Keras to predict heart disease based on health indicators from the provided dataset.
Dataset:
The dataset contains 22 columns, with HeartDiseaseorAttack as the target variable. It consists of various health indicators, including HighBP, BMI, Smoker, Diabetes,etc
